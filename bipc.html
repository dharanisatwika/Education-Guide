        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;"><span id="1_MBBS">1 MBBS</span></h3>
        <p>The most sought after course, in case of Biology group students. The duration of this course is five and a half years. Academic duration is four and a half years. This is followed by an internship that lasts a year. So, combining them together, the duration of MBBS program turns out to be 5.5 years!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As we all know, becoming a Doctor is not too easy. First of all, getting an MBBS seat in a private or Government College is a very difficult task. Then, the course is also not too easy!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Still, doing MBBS and following it up with PG course will help you build a rewarding career. Healthcare business is booming and the demand for well qualified Doctors is expected to shoot up in the future. One may get job in Government or private sectors. Also, opening one’s own Clinic is also a good option!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">MBBS Jobs, Scope &amp; Salary</h4>
        <p>Doctors have access to different types of job opportunities – private jobs, government jobs and self-employment. It is a noble profession. In India, skilled and qualified Doctors (especially the specialists and super specialists) are in huge demand!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>They are usually hired by – super-specialty hospitals, healthcare institutes, hospitals, clinics, rehabilitation centers, old age homes, nursing homes etc. They are even hired by sports teams (as part of the medical team), sports leagues etc.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When it comes to government sector jobs, they are usually hired by – government hospitals, clinics, PHCs, CHCs, rehabilitation centers, mental healthcare institutes etc. Specialists and super-specialists are able to earn decent amount of money in India. A specialist can easily earn around 100-200K INR per month. This figure depends upon the area of specialization though!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;"><span id="2_BDS">2 BDS</span></h3>

        <p>BDS stands for Bachelor of Dental Surgery. The course duration is 5 years. Of those 5 years, classroom studies make up 4 years. 1 year is dedicated towards internship!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Getting into MBBS program is too tough. But getting a BDS seat is relatively easy! But at the same time, career prospects are a bit dim, when compared with MBBS. Still, one may complete BDS, follow it up with PG course and build a good career.</p>
        <p>After completing BDS, candidates may pursue MDS program and specialize in a specific branch of dentistry! This will lead to even better job opportunities and pay package. BDS graduates can earn around 50-80K INR in the beginning. Specialists are able to earn much more than this figure.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>   
        <h3 style="text-align: center;"><span id="3_BAMS">3 BAMS</span></h3>
        <p>B.A.M.S. stands for Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery. If you want to become an Ayurveda Doctor, B.A.M.S. course is for you! The course duration is five and a half years. Four and a half years are dedicated towards classroom courses and rest 1 year towards internship.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>In comparison to M.B.B.S. and BDS programs, getting a seat in BAMS program is easier! And talking about career prospects, the future in this sector is all set to be bright! Take a look at the pace at which Health tourism has been developing in the recent times. Ayurveda resorts and treatment evidently have played an effective role in developing health tourism.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>More and more people are trying out Ayurvedic treatment, thanks to its rising popularity and lack of side effects! So, it is safe to say that job opportunities will certainly increase with time. One may land job in private as well as Government sector.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;"><span id="4_BHMS">4 BHMS</span></h3>
        <p>B.H.M.S. stands for Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery. This course deals with Homeopathic medicines and procedures in detail. The course duration is five and a half years.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>What makes this course valuable is the fact that there are still many people who rely on Homeopathic medication and treatment. So, finding job in Private hospitals won’t be a problem for B.H.M.S. Graduates.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Like MBBS, BDS and BAMS graduates, BHMS graduates too may start their own clinic, dispensary of healthcare institute (homeopathy). In short, they have access to government sector jobs, private sector jobs and self-employment opportunities.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;"><span id="5_BUMS">5 BUMS</span></h3>
        <p>BUMS stands for Bachelor of Unani Medicine and Surgery. It is a 4½ years long professional course. After completing the course, Graduate must also do an unpaid internship lasting a duration of 1 year. Thus, it takes 5½ years to complete this course!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Students who are unable to get admission in courses like MBBS, BDS and BAMS may take up this course. On completing it, they will get the tag of Doctor!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;"><span id="6_BSc_Nursing">6 B.Sc. Nursing</span></h3>
        <p>In Healthcare sector, the demand for well trained and qualified nurses is huge! The demand is increasing with time, but the supply, the number of qualified nurses graduating each year, is not satisfying this demand! In short, qualified nurses are well valued and are rewarded well for their service!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>B.Sc. <a href="https://apnaahangout.com/nursing-courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nursing course</a> is 3 years long. It can be followed up with an M.Sc. Degree. There is a notion that this course is meant exclusively for girls. But it is not true at all! Male candidates too may pursue it.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Ample amounts of jobs are available in both Private as well as Government sectors. Private as well as Government Hospitals are keen to recruit well qualified nurses!</p>
